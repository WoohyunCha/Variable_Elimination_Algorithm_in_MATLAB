# Variable_Elimination_Algorithm_in_MATLAB

Implemented in MATLAB. 

OBSV indicates the observation for evidence variables e.

The function eliminate(x, e, obsv, bn) returns the probability distribution of variable x, given evidence variables and their observation [e, obsv], and a Bayesian network bn.

n1 ~ n5 are the nodes in the Bayesian network
